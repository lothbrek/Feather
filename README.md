#About
Feather is a lightweight Ruby MVC framework. It makes use of Rack, Puma, and Slim.

#Why
Feather was written with the intent to practice and learn; to understand the underlying mechanics of a Ruby MVC. Feather is great to look through if you are interested in seeing how things work 'under the hood' in a Ruby web framework without any magic.

#Documentation
To use, simply clone the app, and run

```ruby
bundle install
```
 To start the server and see your application, run

 ```ruby
 rackup
 ```

 you will see what is in your ```ruby index.slim ``` file by going to ```ruby localhost:9292 ```

As this is a labor of interest, curiosity, and love, the framework will change by how it is used and with examples being added.


#Future

* Add model directory and structure
* Add haml/erb support possibly
* Add examples
* Add error messages
* Add testing
