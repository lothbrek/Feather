#About
Feather is a lightweight Ruby MVC framework.

#Why
Feather was written with the intent to practice and learn; to understand the underlying mechanics of a Ruby MVC. Feather is great to look through if you are interested in seeing how things work 'under the hood' in a Ruby web framework without any magic.

#Documentation
To use, simply clone the app, and run 'bundle install' then 'rackup' - you will see what is in app.rb and be able to edit what you see. Afterwards, go to  localhost:9292 to see your app!

As this is a labor of interest, curiosity, and love, the framework will change by how it is used and with examples being added.

 -- More examples are coming soon
#Future

There will be a set MVC - Model, View, Controller - way of doing things in Feather, and an example project.
